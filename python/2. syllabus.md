<h1 align="center">PYTHON PROGRAMMING</h1>

## OBJECTIVES:
- To read and write simple Python programs.
- To develop Python programs with conditionals and loops.
- To define Python functions and call them.
- To use Python data structures â€“ lists, tuples, dictionaries.
- To do input/output with files in Python.

## GETTING STARTED
- Introduction to Python
- Python Installation
- Python Syntax

## VARIABLES AND OPERATORS
### Variables
- Variables and Assignment

### Operators
- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Bitwise Operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `>>`, `<<`, `~`)
- Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `/=`, `//=`, etc.)
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)
- Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)

---

## DATA TYPES
- Numbers (including booleans)
- Strings and Their Methods
- Lists and Their Methods (including list comprehensions)
- Tuples
- Sets and Their Methods
- Dictionaries
- Type Casting

---

## CONTROL FLOW
- **If Statements:**
  - The `if` statement
  - The `if-else` statement
  - The `if-elif-else` statement

- **Loops:**
  - The `for` loop (and the `range()` function)
  - The `while` loop
  - The `break` statement
  - The `continue` statement
  
- **Try Statements:**
  - Exception Handling
  - The `try` and `except` blocks

---

## FUNCTIONS
- Function Definition (`def` and `return` statements)
- Scopes of Variables Inside Functions (global and nonlocal statements)
- Default Argument Values
- Keyword Arguments
- Arbitrary Argument Lists
- Unpacking Argument Lists (`*` and `**` statements)
- Lambda Expressions (`lambda` statement)
- Documentation Strings
- Function Annotations
- Function Decorators

---

## CLASSES
- Class Definition (`class` statement)
- Class Objects
- Instance Objects
- Method Objects
- Class and Instance Variables
- Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance

---

## MODULES AND PACKAGES
- Modules (`import` statement)
- Packages

---

## ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS
- Handling Exceptions (`try` statement)
- Raising Exceptions (`raise` statement)

---

## FILES
- Reading and Writing Files (`with` statement)
- Methods of File Objects

---

## ADDITIONAL TOPICS
